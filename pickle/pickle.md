The trained model (pickle) is too large for GitHub. Download it from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PpUy9nkPIpzvdHHDD-el9eJ5A4c_8k4o/view?usp=drive_link) and place it where the notebooks expect it (example path):
- Download: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PpUy9nkPIpzvdHHDD-el9eJ5A4c_8k4o/view?usp=drive_link
